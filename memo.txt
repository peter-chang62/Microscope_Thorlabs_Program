Flow of this Project: 

1. DataStreamApplication.py was used to stream 1 GaGe card

2. RUN_DataStreamApplication.py extended the application to run 2 GaGe cards.
This version of the code is what was used for the shocktube experiments. 

3. main.py further extended the application so that it now uses two GaGe cards
and two Thorlabs translation stages to run a microscopy system.
